# TatRaksha (Track 5): agent instructions

The spec is `docs/PRD.md` (58 sections). Read §8 (core journey), §31–§38 (entities, AI, APIs, FRs)
and §57 (build priority) before writing code. Do not build Priority 2+ items until the Priority 1
journey works end to end.

## Non-negotiables (from the PRD pack)
- Gemini never invents measurements. Give it structured context and require schema-validated JSON
  (`services/api/app/ai/gemini.py::generate_structured`). Separate observed data → AI interpretation → recommendation.
- Every AI-generated record stores `model_name`, `model_version`, `prompt_version`.
- Every data point carries source + timestamp. Sample/synthetic data is labelled as such in the data and the UI.
- Canonical schema + state adapters; at least two state configs (Odisha / Fani 2019 replay, West Bengal / Amphan 2020 replay, Andhra Pradesh (rainfall flooding)).
- Consequential actions (alerts, transfers, advisories, recommendations) need human approval.
- Exactly two roles: District Disaster Management Officer and State EOC Officer.
- Never commit secrets. Config comes from `.env` (see `.env.example`).
- Cite every reused dataset/model/library in `THIRD_PARTY.md`.

## Layout and ports
- `apps/district-dashboard` → :3050 · `apps/state-eoc-dashboard` → :3051 (Next.js 16, pnpm workspace; read `apps/*/AGENTS.md`)
- `services/api` → :8050 (FastAPI, uv, Python 3.12). Domain services listed in `services/*/README.md`
  start as routers/modules inside `services/api/app/`; split to separate Cloud Run services only if needed.
- Prompts in `ai/prompts/` (versioned filenames, e.g. `extract_v1.md`), schemas in `ai/schemas/`.

## Commands
- `pnpm dev:api`, `pnpm dev:district-dashboard`, `pnpm dev:state-eoc-dashboard`
- `pnpm test:api`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`
